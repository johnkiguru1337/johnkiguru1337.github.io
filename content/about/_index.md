## ~/About me$ 

I am the one you've been looking for, like a bug in your code! I recently came across this article, it made me chuckle :)

"But did you, in your three-piece psychology and 1950’s technobrain, never take a look behind the eyes of the hacker ? Did you ever wonder what made him tick, what forces shaped him, what may have molded him?I am a hacker, enter my world… Mine is a world that begins with school… I’m smarter than most of the other kids, this crap they teach us bores me… Damn underachiever. They’re all alike."
